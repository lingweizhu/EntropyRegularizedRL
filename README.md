# Munchausen Reinforcement Learning

This is an implementation of [Munchausen Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14430) based on [TF Agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents).

Currently it is only subclassing DQN module from TF Agents and rewrite the loss function. Might extend to a complete version later.
